            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am currently a computer engineering student pursuing a computer science minor at Stony Brook University while interning as an IT Technician on campus.</p>
            <p>My interest lie in embedded systems and cybersecurity. In the future, I will work on IoT devices to make sure users are protected.</p>
            <p>I also love to explore the outdoors, hit the gym and try new cuisines.</p>

            <h2>Frequency Meter System with Auto Ranging</h2>
            <p>
             Designed a system that measures the frequency of a waveform using Embedded Microprocessor Systems Design Techniques with precision. The device utilized an ATmega324A Microcontroller and takes in a waveform as a input. The device used the ATmega324A's built-in Timer/Counters to determine whether measuring the period or the frequency will be more precise. A LCD DOG display was integrated into the design to display the period, frequency, and duty cycle. The device's software was developed in the Assembly language and utilized efficient management of subroutines and Interrupt Service Routines to measure the frequency with a precision of 0.01%.

            <h2>Personal Website</h2>
            <p>
            You're looking at it right now! I used HTML and CSS to make this website.

            <h2>Minesweeper Project</h2>
            <p>
             I used concepts such as object-oriented programming, recursion and basic data structures. Recreated the retro game using Java in Eclipse and implemented a GUI using JavaFX

            <h2>DAC Saw-Wave Generator</h2>
            <p>
             Designed a system that generated a saw-wave with a Digital-to-Analog Converter using the Direct Digital Synthesis concept. The data path and controller units was implemented with the Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) Ice40HX1k on IceStick board and DAC MCP48901. The analog signal is approximated with an 8-bit DAC which communicates with the controller (Master) through a 3-wire link compatible with Serial Peripheral Interface(SPI). The DAC operates as a SPI Slave and the SPI Master that generates the chip select was designed using logic gates, flipflops and multiplexers.

            <h2>Alarm Clock</h2><!--I want to have a picture of the project sweep over when I hover-->
            <p>
                -Used PSpice to simulate the circuit
                -Programmed the micro controller in Atmel Studio
                -Manually soldered in electrical components on PCB board
